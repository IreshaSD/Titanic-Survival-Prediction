# Overview

This code comprises data analysis and predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset using Python's libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. It explores data visualization, preprocessing, and trains a Logistic Regression model to predict survival on the Titanic.

# Description

The code analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand various factors influencing survival rates, including gender, age, passenger class, and embarkation. It preprocesses the data by handling missing values and converts categorical columns into numerical form for modeling. It then builds and evaluates a Logistic Regression model to predict survival probabilities based on given attributes.

# Features

* Data Loading and Inspection
* Missing Values Handling
* Statistical Analysis of Data
* Visualization of Survival Counts based on different attributes
* Data Preprocessing for Modeling
* Splitting the Dataset into Training and Test Sets
* Training a Logistic Regression Model
* Evaluating Model Accuracy

# Usage

* Data Loading and Inspection: Load the Titanic dataset and inspect its structure.
* Missing Values Handling: Check and handle missing values in columns like 'Age' and 'Embarked'.
* Statistical Analysis and Visualization: Explore survival counts based on attributes like 'Sex', 'Pclass', 'Embarked', and 'Age' using count plots.
* Data Preprocessing: Convert categorical columns into numerical values for modeling.
* Model Training: Split the data into training and test sets. Train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on both training and test datasets.

# How to Use

* Ensure Python environment with required libraries is set up.
* Download or access the Titanic dataset.
* Copy the provided code into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code with Python extension).
* Run the code step by step to load, preprocess, visualize, train, and evaluate the model.

# Notes

* Ensure the Titanic dataset file path is correctly specified.
* Random state parameter (e.g., random_state=2) ensures reproducibility of the train-test split.
* Accuracy score is used as an evaluation metric for the Logistic Regression model.
